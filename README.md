# classify_sklearn
An introduction to machine learning, covering both practical and theoretical aspects. Let's watch the process in action, make the machine learn, and understand why we call it machine learning. Why do we claim that the machine is learning something? What is the basis of this statement? What's going on behind the scenes? Although the machine does not learn in the same way as a human being, we will make analogies with human learning. What really matters is whether the machine will be able to help us with the computational models we create to achieve our goals.

Our objective here will not be to delve into each of these areas, but rather to understand the process in its entirety so that you are able to apply it. This way, when you encounter difficulties, you can delve deeper into the specific areas you need.
